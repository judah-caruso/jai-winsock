# Winsock

Original Winsock bindings for the Jai language. Note this is **not** Winsock 2, that is [here](https://github.com/judah-caruso/jai-winsock2).

# Usage

See `examples/winsock_test.jai` for basic UDP & TCP servers ported from C++.

# Note

This techincally depends on my [C interop module](https://github.com/judah-caruso/C).
However, I've localized it for reasons outlined in `c.jai`.
